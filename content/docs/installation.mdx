You don't need to install it as a dependency instead you can simply copy and paste the code, as shadcn/ui, into your project. However, you still need to install the other dependency that the code needs.

## Requirements

1. **TailwindCSS**: We use TailwindCSS for styling. See the [TailwindCSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) for more information.

2. **Framer Motion** : All of the animations and animated components are using Framer Motion. See the [Framer Motion documentation](https://www.framer.com/api/motion/) for more information.

3. **Lucide Icons**: Some components use [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/guide/packages/lucide-react) or [Radix Icons](https://radix-ui.com/icons). You can use any other icon library or SVG icons as well.

## Setting up

### Install util dependencies

```bash
  npm i framer-motion clsx tailwind-merge
```

### Add util file

Create `utils.ts` file in the `libs` folder and paste the following code:

```ts
import { ClassValue, clsx } from 'clsx'
import { twMerge } from 'tailwind-merge'

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs))
}
```
